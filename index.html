          I am currently an undergraduate at RMIT university in Vietnam. My
          major is Information Technology, and my intended minor is Mobile and
          Web Development. During the last level of my gifted high school, I
          learned that I have a passion for numbers and programming; I would like
          to observe what happened after my personal computer, my iPhone, iPad,
          and iPod, how they work, why they work, and how to do their work. That
          is why I am here, to perform my ambitious action, to make my dream
          come true, to be an IT Engineer in the near future.

            From the results of three online personality tests, I have got my strength and weakness for developing myself in studying. Also, the test clearly shows all relevant aspects that may boost my mindset up, help me connect to great peers when forming a team.<br>
            <br>
            The team members whom I would like to work with as a group is represented via the following discussion:<br>
            <br>
            The peer should communicate well with each member and stakeholder. Simon Holdorf, an author of freecodecamp.org, stated that someone concisely presents ideas and solutions, especially in planning on working in a team. Seventy percent of extraverted mind from Myers- Briggs test, I would be interested in exciting thinking from a highly productive discussion.<br>
            <br>
            The team member should apply some relevant frameworks and prototypes to the IT projects. Frameworks are considered essential tools for a developer to perform their computing with a layout formed while prototype helps team members ensure the project's structure. As a result, this makes another one understands what each member's solution means. My learning style is visual, meaning the peer may show solutions or ideas that have visual and intuitive representation and color-code things.<br>
            <br>
            The last test shows that I have the ability to be a leader. I also would like to support and help everyone when the peer gets into trouble in some problems during the computing time. I also would like to motivate each member to accomplish the task and discuss with stakeholders to ensure the flow of the code. Henceforth, the peer I would like to work with must be willing to get feedback from others and support and help other team members. The peer must know that being a team, they are not alone in solving problems.<br>
            <br>
            (Simon Holdrf, 021) said that: "Do not be afraid of failure! The more ways we try at something, the more likely we are to succeed". I hope each member will apply technological breakthroughs into their projects to make them creative, distinction, and unique as I learned that innovative products would be a part of the world trend. Moreover, making an effort to develop reckless ideas and solutions is a plus to be my team member.<br>

        <h1 id="projectidea"> PROJECT IDEA</h1>
        (CHRISTINA NUNEZ, 2019) As the world seeks to slow the pace of climate change, preserve wildlife, and support billions of people, trees inevitably hold a significant part of the answer.<br>
        However, preserving forests is not easy, especially forest fire. In the 21st century, a forest fire is a severe problem. The global governances do not have precise solutions to prevent a forest from a fire-affected by natural and human activities factors.<br>
        <br>
        (Julia Perez, 2017) commented that an uncontrolled forest fire can devastate everything in its path, spread for miles, crossing rivers and roads. Each year, between 60,000 and 80,000 forest fires occur, destroying between 3 and 10 million hectares. While forest fires have different environmental impacts, depending on their size and frequency, the solution is still a big question unsolved.<br>
        <br>
        That is why I came up with an application to prevent the forest from a serious fire.<br>
        <strong>Project Name: FAP</strong> <br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">a. Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          FAP is an application which stands for Fire Alarm App, is an essential application for preserving and preventing the forests from fire. The project including Arduino, module sim and GPS, and a sensor device. The sensor device would be responsible for collecting the data around the device and send back to the Arduino system before the system accomplish the final step of sending the alarm to the relevant audience. The most crucial target is to warn the relevant audience of some unusual situation in the forest to give some practical solutions and reduce disasters as quickly as possible. On the other hand, the fire alarm app also focuses on mining data for research and predicting weather phenomena, supporting clarifying some problems related to nature and environmental factors.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">b. Motivation:</h3>

          Wildfire is a global situation in which any national government does not have specific solutions to this issue. The Fire alarm app is simple, but its vital functions and meaningful purpose are why it stays here. According to the chart research from National Interagency Fire Center, during the period 1983- 2021, show the total number of wildfires per year is as presented below:<br>
          <picture>
            <img src="assets/img/jpg/Screen Shot 2021-08-16 at 19.30.35.png" width="60%" class="align_picture">
          </picture>
          <br>
          During this period, just in the United States, National Interagency Fire Center confirmed an average of 70,000 forest fires per year. However, The Forest Service has shown that the number of wildfires would be even higher than the data processed from the National Interagency. Indeed, there is no specific number to show the clear impacts related to humans and life there. Everything the human should do is to the preservation and ready at any emergency time. According to the market, the price of the sensor is reasonable, adapt to the budget of the government’s finance in preserving the forest. The Fire alarm app is an example of solving emergencies via timely solutions.<br>

          The fire alarm app is a project including sensor device including position sensor, temperature sensor, and solar battery which is set up into a device; 2 kinds of the module including Module Sim and Module GPS; the Arduinos, an application to process the data from the Arduino and send to the relevant audience.<br>
          <picture>

          </picture>
          <br>
          The solar battery is used in sensor devices to supply boundless energy. The power is given from the sunlight, especially in dangerous places such as forests that humans may have some difficulties approaching and fixing if necessary.<br>
          <picture>
            <img src="assets/img/jpg/Screen Shot 2021-08-16 at 19.31.59.png" width="60%" class="align_picture">
          </picture>
          <br>
          Before the wildfire appears, the temperature may increase temporarily, by the nature factor until the forest fire happens, the sensor device will send the clue to the Arduino. During the period from abnormal temperature change to the appearance of the fire, this is an example of big data to show more evidence and time for the relevant audience to solve the problems.<br>
          <picture>
            <img src="assets/img/jpg/Screen Shot 2021-08-16 at 19.32.19.png" width="60%" class="align_picture">
          </picture>
          <br>
          At this time, the Arduino sends the data to module GPS and module Sim. While module GPS is responsible for identifying the position of forest fire, module Sim issues a warning via a message or emergency notification.<br>
          <picture>
            <img src="assets/img/jpg/Screen Shot 2021-08-16 at 19.32.46.png" width="60%" class="align_picture">
          </picture>
          <br>
          The Fire alarm app is set up to code the back-end. When the data and clue are given from the Arduino via module Sim and module GPS, the application can process the data. However, the primary function is to warn the position on Map and abnormal temperature, leading to fire hazards. Fire alarm app also provides a solution via AI technology, meaning the application would save previous data, compared new data, and give the optimal solution based on different situations. For example, the application would scan multiple times to check the amplitude change of the temperature. If the temperature range abnormal threshold exceeds (over 40 degrees), the application instantly issues a warning to related objects.<br>
          <picture>
            <img src="assets/img/jpg/Screen Shot 2021-08-16 at 19.33.40.png" width="60%" class="align_picture">
          </picture>
          The Application has completely accomplished the most important mission of issuing a warning to relevant audiences as soon as possible to give them the valuable time to give the best solutions for the emergency. After issuing a warning, all functions return to the initial step forever. <br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, the application is also helpful for the forest every day. The sensor device would scan multiple time, send the data to the Arduino, process the data and send to the phone related via module Sim and module GPS. This storing data method is an example of big data where temperature, GPS, and time are updated each second. It is considered a tool to support seismologists and geographers to research and discover areas with unique structures and properties. Scientists would have robust data to predict the different situations based on seasons, months, and periods in the long term. As a result, the human can reduce the riskiness of the forest fire. <br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, The Fire Alarm Application is an essential tool to issue a warning fire from the forest to relevant audiences and support them give timely solutions to reduce the dire situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, the application can collect the data to provide the chart and different kinds of information via periods such as a month, year for scientists’ researching demand and create predictions to prevent severe disasters in the future.<br>

          <strong> Software: Fire Alarm Application</strong><br>
          1. Back-end by Python programming.<br>
          2. Front-end (interface for user) by HTML, CSS, Javascript.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">e. Skills required:</h3>
        <p>
          The team would be set up based on different skills. The projects need an application to process the data; this needs back-end skill. Moreover, interface design including CSS, HTML, and Javascript for users. Moreover, Applying Big Data and the Arduinos into the project is also considered seriously as this is the most critical project. On the other hand, the team members also have to communicate and contact outside to ask for help and ensure the operational process flow; significantly, many Arduinos and the Coding community are willing to answer complicated questions from the project. <br>
          <br>
          For the supply chain of components, the items I listed before are available in Vietnam and were provided diversely in some e-commerce; some unique things such as a solar battery, the module can be found from the shopping community on social media. Practically, these components are widespread and expected to build a realistic project.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">f. Outcome:</h3>
        <p>
          If this project becomes successful, the forest is protected and preserved carefully. Most situations related to human or natural factors should be considered seriously—the project focuses on preventing wildfire and predicting the warning as soon as possible. The project would inspire the human to continue coming up with intelligent solutions to keep the earth green. On the other hand, the Fire alarm app also provides data to research for predicting the different kinds of weather and gain more experience for disaster in the future. In general, Fire alarm application appears to protect the forest, and support the human in predicting the disaster to give timely solutions.

        <p>
          Since this is a technological project for a global solution and plays a vital role in maintaining the earth's green ecosystem, Fire Alarm App would be considered in any aspect of life. The project gets variety of high-quality feedback that show entirely the potential impact and inadequacy represented as below:<br>

          <strong style="color: rgb(3, 3, 126);"> Duc Dang Khoa- Information Technology- RMIT university:</strong> <br>
          <br>
          “From my perspective, the fire alarm is a clever project; the combination of GPS, Arduinos, and AI potentially reduces the natural fire in the forest. Since it announces the relevant audiences to reach to the fire in time and collect data from seasons to identify abnormal temperature, however, this project has a big problem: the installment and maintenance expenses are extremely high as I know that the temperature sensor range is not very far between each one. Therefore, how can you manage all of them, precisely how many devices you attempt to install in the forest? Furthermore, have you exclude the case that some animals could eat those devices?”<br>

        <strong style="color: rgb(3, 3, 126);">Nguyen Le Ngoc Thuong- English language study- University of Foreign language studies:</strong><br>
          <br>
          “From my point of view, this project is excellent. It can help people a lot in warning fire, even with long distances. So obviously, we can shorten the time for solutions. It helps cope with fire difficulties, and this one can also give researchers a massive range of figures or information essential for their work. Another positive point is that its units and its process are pretty cutting-edge. Henceforth, most people can easily catch up and take full advantage of this device. Furthermore, honestly, I am extremely awaiting it and hope that it will come to life soon.”<br>
          <br>
        <strong style="color: rgb(3, 3, 126);">Tran Dinh Duong- Information Technology- RMIT university:</strong><br>
          <br>
          “The Fire-Alarm-App concept carries tremendous potential financially. The practical and direct approach of using a mobile application, which could be carried in everybody’s pocket, as a Fire-Alarm could become one of the most impactful ideas for an extended period. Using Solar-powered equipment has a valuable application in open areas such as on top of trees in forests. Using data collected and AI technologies and further developments, the Fire-Alarm-App potentially is the new wild-fire-preventing protocol and standard in the future.”<br>
          <br>
        <strong style="color: rgb(3, 3, 126);">Nguyen Minh Anh- Professional Communication- RMIT university:</strong><br>
          “After reading your plan about the fire alarm application, I think it is a practical application while forest fires are increasing. With data and timely notification to the authorities to prevent and promptly handle serious consequences, the application is unique and can bring many benefits.”<br>
        <strong style="color: rgb(3, 3, 126);">My Comment about these feedbacks:</strong><br>
          <br>
          The feedback is significant for me. All of them appreciate the importance of the project when fire alarm applications show the solution for the global situation. The comment from them also motivates me to accomplish realistic projects in the following steps. However, I also get feedback to improve the project's performance, or some lousy impact would happen when the system is performed.  I agree with some recommendations that animals would damage these sensor devices in the forest. Managing the project can lead to dangerous activities, especially under challenging locations such as forests. That is a part of the project, get feedback, come up with a solution and give the best response to be successful. I also focus on critical thinking comments for my project, meaning praise motivates me, yet some recommendations will show me ineffective. As a result, I have to research over and over again until it is entirely successful. That is also a beneficial point for me to increase my experience in the IT industry.<br>
          <br>
          The feedback is also the knowledge that helps me avoid the problems again for the future improvements, help me have a good looking in the overview of the project, to understand and know how to apply the advanced technology into the application to make it perfect as quickly as possible.<br>

          In my ideal project, Fire alarm application has not only issues wildfire warnings but also store and mine the data for research purposes. Henceforth, the application must utilize cloud computing technology and the Arduinos device.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: snow;">a. Cloud computing technology</h3>
        <p>
          How can I store enormous data updated per second? how can I sign in to my device to research, navigate, observe, and check daily life when I am in a foreign country or even work from home? How can I synchronize the data where our team members can observe in other positions? These great questions make me consider Cloud computing Technology.<br>
          <br>
          Could computing Technology is not old, this Technology is developing and still getting breakthrough from technology empires. As can be seen from Google Docs, Google Drive of Google, Amazon web services of Amazon technology company, or even Documentary folder share from Zalo application of VNG Vietnam company, these are examples of cloud computing technology. In the next ten years, cloud computing technology would be the core tool to associate with everything from users in the world. <br>
          <br>
          There is no doubt that cloud computing technology plays an essential part in developing the internet system of the world. Considering what cloud computing technology can be done now, for example, when the company develops an online platform in Ho Chi Minh city, and completely share everything including File, Folder, Documentary, Audio and Video File to the standard system named CLOUD. Someone, who works from home because of the COVID-10 pandemic, can download the data from CLOUD and continue working on this project. On the other hand, the technology company considers cloud computing a core and vital tool because of its reasonable and economical cost. Precisely, the user spends money on the space they store most of the data for their user and project and does not maintain the Technology fee. Imagine the last ten years; how can the human store digital files by USB or memory stick, and the user spend a considerable amount of money to own it. At this time, cloud computing technology is available for all people via the internet system. Moreover, data security is one of the essential criteria of most businesses in the world. The company never predicts what any disaster may happen, and exploit important documentary of the company, cloud computing technology, with its storing function, the user can back up and protect precious data in a secure place.<br>
          <br>
          In 2020, according to Synergy Research, Google had gained 9 percent of the market share in cloud services. Meanwhile, Microsoft has dramatically increased to 20 percent, a third of the market from Amazon, the Amazon web service company. As a result, cloud computing technology would be an indispensable part of the internet system in the next three years. Thirty-five percent of growth and 120 billion dollars is the prediction from Forrester research in 2021 for cloud services infrastructure. As can be seen from the e-commerce trend of the world, there is a steady growth in online commercial platforms such as Lazada (China), Tiki (Vietnam), Shoppe (Indonesia), especially Amazon (The US); without cloud service, these company would lose many facilities, labor, and other related advanced technological breakthrough. In another world, cloud computing would form the internet world where the user uses it the most; many of them are social media, e-commerce, company virtual solution, data privacy, and security.<br>
          <br>
          In the future, Amazon, Google, or Microsoft would have a solid ability to develop and maintain the performance for cloud services infrastructure. Some companies which provide social media, such as Facebook, Spotify, Twitter, Instagram, also utilize cloud computing to store data from users and ensure it is protected at all times. In other words, cloud computing is always necessary for any company which toward user’s demand via internet system, and also be a potential aspect that Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or other related technology empire is willing to research, develop, update and maintain for a better profit, and better life.
          Cloud computing is developing and new for some careers. This Technology can lead to potential impacts in many aspects of life such as entertainment, education, health care, communication, and shopping; especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, humans can judge the importance of cloud computing. With this Technology, the user conveniently gains access to what kinds of information they would like. For example, people tend to use Netflix, Disney Plus, FPT play to watch movies, and exciting shows which were just taken place in the past; they can do online shopping on e-commerce such as Alibaba (China), Shoppe (Indonesia). Moreover, Google or Microsoft Team provide online studying platform, this learning distance support student to study and follow the course from home. In the long term, this Technology would change human behaviors. Many of them do everything at home, appreciate quick connection, adapt flexibility into the job, and choose the fastest solutions from the most urgent situations. To sum up, cloud computing would positively change human activities, life demands, behavior, and characteristics.<br>
          <br>
          As cloud computing has appeared in much-specialized software, this Technology would affect anyone willing to gain access to the internet ecosystem. They take part in various internet websites and applications to do whatever they want, based on their demand, favorite, and carving. It is hard to identify what kinds of people will be most affected. To clarify, it is the people who know how to apply Technology into their life to make it more convenient, better, and happier.
          Cloud computing is likely to change human activities and working processes. People can work from home; they tend to approach clients and stakeholders via online method, no office, no building, no address, everything is back up and stored on the cloud. On the other hand, some careers may disappear; many of them are guard, service jobs. <br>
          <br>
          For entertainment, I have used Netflix, Spotify, Youtube to watch movies and shows. For education, I have used Microsoft Team, Canvas, Outlook to take part in courses in my university. I have also utilized external educational platforms such as Google Docs, Google Classroom, and Discord to communicate, discuss, plan, and work together with team members. In general, I can deny the importance of applying cloud computing technology to websites and applications. <br>
          <br>
          In the past, If I have more questions, I will go to school, make an appointment with the teacher and ask about my problems. However, today, I can communicate with my lecture in university via chatting platform or email. This does not only help me save precious time, access quick connections, gain productive performance, and show me how to work with Technology and how to apply it into daily life to make my life better, more convenient, and happier.<br>
          <br>
          Ten years ago, the smartphone was expensive. Not everyone can own a smartphone to make a video call or even spend money making a typical long-distance call. After ten years, something has changed, supported by cloud computing; people do not even need to spend more money to see each family member. I can communicate with my relatives in the US from Vietnam and share something special after a hard-working day with my parents. As someone said that Technology was born to make life more beautiful, and cloud computing is a typical example.<br>
          <h3 style="color: snow;">b. The Arduinos system</h3>
          <p>
            <br>
            The Arduinos are not new. These days, Arduinos becomes the most important and popular component in many electronic products in the world. Because of its widespread presence, there is much Arduinos community that is ready to answer any questions from beginners; this community is also a place where the new trend of electronic products appears. Imagine someone would like to come up with an interactive object. The Arduinos is a vital part of it, to perform the user’s need via open-source electronics platform, or board and the software to program the solutions. Arduinos is beneficial as it makes electronics products more convenient, flexible, accessible, and easy to conduct the project within Arduinos. On the other hand, The Arduinos is open-source and built by hand; it is quickly innovated based on user’s demands.<br>
            <br>
            Imaging the Arduinos is the body, and this component needs a brain to be active to be an electronic device; a brain is set up via programming. That is why Arduinos are essential in many technological aspects of life that there is no clear static to prove all strengths about Arduinos. The community, products, and breakthrough trends around Arduinos could be compared to IOS and the Android ecosystem.<br>
            <br>
            Compared to IOS, or Android ecosystem, the Arduinos also develops steadily; An Arduinos system dramatically provide natural products that interact to the user and related objects in many kinds of different demands, one of them are sensor system, The Arduinos can create sensor system to measure the value and factor that related to natural resources such as measuring temperature, humidity, light intensity, object color, toxic gas detection, velocity. Moreover, The Arduinos system is also available for inventing LCD screens or LED light Technology. On the other hand, some advanced electronic products support wireless Technology such as Bluetooth, 3G, GPS, Wifi, 2.4 GHz). Indeed, It is impossible to list all the unbelievable electronic products that the Arduinos system has done until now.
            Someone said that: “Think big, do big.” That is entirely true for the Arduinos system. This Technology could be applied to severe global problems of the world. How can people get a warning from a dangerous place without setting up offline security there? How do they control natural factors in the forest? How can they get a clue that tells something wrong from the sea, beach, mountain, especially somewhere is hard to approach? The Arduinos are an adequate answer. With the Arduinos system, people can follow all activities far away, get a warning, request a timely solution, responsive to the system via board or programming application to solve the problem as quickly as possible. The Arduinos community can develop fly cam, VR technology, mini recording device via the Arduinos system. It is undoubtedly believed that The Arduinos system is likely to develop to tackle global solutions.<br>
            <br>
            To make the Arduinos system great, the national government should give practical policies to motivate engineers to invent technological breakthroughs by utilizing the Arduinos system. Moreover, some big technological empires such as Google and Apple should spend specific money developing electronic products via the Arduinos system as it provides an intelligent global solution and may create profit for the investors.<br>
            <br>
            The potential impact of the Arduinos system is obvious to see. The Arduinos are a tool to make the products elective, and these products can create profit. To clarify, the Arduinos Technology can prevent fire from facilities in the home, building, company, and support relevant audiences to preserve and protect natural factors seriously such as forest, mountain, and island to avoid natural disasters such as earthquake, wildfire, etc. volcano, tsunami.<br>
            <br>
            The Arduinos system is also a vital part of bid data by collecting the data per second, send related information to different modules for research and navigation. As a result, the human has precious and essential data used to predict, and give the effective solutions based on a variety of situations.
            The Arduinos system is developing quickly, yet it is not easy to identify what is likely to change. For example, Robotics technology is used for supply chain products, provides production line chains for factories, and engineers can use the Arduinos system to do some sensors to ensure the quality of the products. The world is significant, and user’s demand is different, it leads to the difference of sensor value in each specific product. Moreover, The Arduinos may be innovated to adapt to the diversity of options and unique requirements in the future.<br>
            <br>
            Technology was born to make human life smarter, happier, more convenient, and comfortable; and, so does the Arduinos system. The customer sometimes does not know the intelligent products they use come from the Arduinos system. Henceforth, the engineer, especially the people who directly take part in researching and developing electronic products via the Arduinos system, will be affected the most, as they have to change, research, and repeatedly develop to follow the development of the 21st-century technology world. The Arduinos system does not make any current jobs or technologies redundant as this system is considered a body that needs a brain to make it an interactive product.
            In my daily life, The Arduinos system is necessary. As I study IT, I would like to explore and combine it with other Technology, serving for studying and learning. Moreover, the Arduinos system is fascinating to utilize for the realistic project in the future. Every day, I use smartphones for daily activities; that is a clear example of how the Arduinos system stays in my life. On the other hand, let us mention some electronic products such as fly cam and underground cable fault recognition using the Arduinos Board. I am interested in what the Arduinos did. It inspires me to discover more about it, to make something big for life.<br>
            <br>
            My family member also uses the Arduinos system to make some sensors to issue fire warnings or electricity sensors. Meanwhile, my friends often use products that have this system. There is no doubt that the Arduinos system is present in most aspects of human life. In my ideal project, Fire alarm application has not only issues wildfire warnings but also store and mine the data for research purposes. Henceforth, the application must utilize cloud computing technology and the Arduinos device.<br>

          -	The sever use to connect multiple client GUI and remote to config hardware board.<br>
          -	Before I work at INPHI company, I have worked at an FPT software company for two years as a Junior embedded software engineering and interned for three months.<br>
          <br>
          -	This role helps me to develop my skill set such as testing framework, software life cycle, document design, communicate with customers for solving some critical issue,<br>
          -	design pattern for codding, debugging with the logger, clean code, hardware specification, and most especially like I have a chance to invoke to Automotive domain.<br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">2.Please tell us about the industry you work in </h3><br>
        <br>
          -	My current domain is telematic (networking). Moreover, I am also doing firmware API for the chip platform in the data center, supporting these stations' transmission bandwidth with high-speed series of 100GB, 500GB.<br>
          <br>
        <strong>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</strong><br>
          -	As a senior, I have to train my team members, especially internship or fresher, to support and direct them to the target and show explicit instruction if necessary. As you know, the fresher, despite having substantial knowledge enough to take part in the workplace, still have less skill or experience to solve the situations that always happen in the working process.<br>
          <br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h3><br>
          -	As I participated in many more than two technological companies, I have more chances to work with different people in this technology information market. They are project manager, project leader, tech- lead, co-worker, client-side, including clients, users, and stakeholders. For example, during the working process, questions, discussion, and decisions are always available between team members toward the common target of the project. If something is wrong (both hardware and software mentioned), the client-side is considered debugging or getting feedback. On the other hand, project manager, tech- lead, or manager responsible for technique, is a part of career, to get the best unify in each department.<br>
          <br>

Based on different aspects of the project, I would identify the person who can master the work. More clearly, there are many everyday tasks for me to work with IT professionals, especially system design, detail design, propose a solution, resolve the issue, and review code; these everyday tasks are necessary to ensure the flow and the purpose of the project, the most interaction in IT workplace is trustworthy respect and collaboration as we need to unify to make the project successful.<br>
          <br>
          <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">6.What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3><br>
          -	This question is available for a project manager who ultimately responds to all fields to the client and investor sides.  Practically, the employee would get tech-lead notifications of what clients and investors request in their projects. As a result, the IT developer must clarify a specification about a new feature via conservation between clients, investors, and stakeholders. <br>
          <br>
          -	Then, the team will analyze, define time, cost based on the difficulty of the new feature.<br>
          <br>
          -	The team will analyze the new requirement; the software team will define the system architect and detail module design before providing a specific trial version for clients and investors.<br>
          <br>
          HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THE END.<br>
          <br>
          -	The team start getting feedback from client and investor, resolve problems when integrating module from the client, module from software team in case bringing up a product.<br>
          <br>
          -	If the requirement is unclear, Q&A is essential to clarify repeatedly; some fundamental impacts from these crucial meetings are specification product and hardware documentary.<br>
          <br>
          <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">7.What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3><br>
          <br>
          -	As I mentioned above, accomplishing the project's final step is not the end; the software team must get feedback or new requirements from the client and investor. Henceforth, the most time-consuming stage is product quality testing., the process finishes until everything from the project must get the highest unify between, client-side and the software team.<br>
          <br>
          <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3><br>
          -	There are many, and many new things that happened in IT career, it is a fact. For example, the most challenging is fixing the issue of some modules I have never seen before, resolving the module's bug that comes from the client-side when running an integrated system.<br>
          <br>
          <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 104);">9.Finally, can you share example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3><br>
          <br>
          -	Optimizing the performance of the system needs an amount of time than someone thinks. To optimize the performance of the system, the developer must have a strong knowledge foundation and experience to master any brach of the project; optimizing the performance of the project is also a chance to have an overview vision for the whole project, help IT developer observe, and discover something new and unique. As a result, they can develop any aspects of the IT industry, meaning they can identify and direct themselves what the next technology is available to adapt to the development of the world.<br>
          <br>
          “Thank you Mr. Pham Duy Khuong. The meeting is very precious for me to follow the footstep and help me clarify something I do not understand clearly in the studying process. I believe that your sharing would motivate and support me to study well before officially take part in the IT industry.”<br>
          <br>
          <strong style="text-align: center;color: rgb(1, 39, 82);"> My Comment:</strong> <br>
          <br>
          Thanks to the great interview, these questions show me a clear road map on identifying and developing the skill to get to the next level of my career in the future. Mr. Khuong also kindly provide the working process in a project in detail, help me clarify how to solve the problems with team members, clients, investors, and stakeholders. Moreover, He also focuses on optimizing the system and reminds the importance and difficulty as I have to have strong knowledge and experience to master most aspects of the projects. Understanding precise requirements and constructive meetings between team members and project manager is also a plus to follow and improve my technology leadership.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, Mr. Khuong has a road map to be a tech- lead toward technique; his road map inspires me to identify the road map for myself in the first year of the university environment and help me have a good-looking vision about my career. Indeed, the answer from Mr. Khuong would be the foundation for me to choose what the best for me in the next road of learning and working in this IT industry.<br>
